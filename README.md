# LinearRegressionCalculator

LinearRegressionCalculator is a barebones Android app that calculates the optimum parameters for a linear regression problem.
It implements the Gradient Descent (with a live graph of `J()`) and Normal Equation algorithms.
It's my very first native Android app, and also one of the first Java projects I've worked on, so please be gentle with my messy code.
